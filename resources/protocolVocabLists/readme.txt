The 'master' list is targetPestGroups.csv. All the other lists refer to the target pest groups by ID. Some list items belong to more than one target pest group; a given pest group can have zero or more instances of a list.
For example, tpg-2 "Fall and Southern Armyworm", can be caught in four types of trap, but are not associated with any 'Substrates'. Conversely, the Host 'Plantae' is common to many  target pests.

There may be scope in future to link 'substrate' to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonized_System. This is less important in 'post-border' surveillance than for 'at border' inspections of goods.

Lures that contain named pure substances (e.g. methyl eugenol) could also in future be linked to CAS numbers. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAS_Registry_Number
